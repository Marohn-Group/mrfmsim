"""For experiments with shared nodes, some nodes are housed here.

It is possible to put all the nodes here, however, it is not recommended to do that
because that would make it difficult to read and debug.
For some single operations, instead of using lambda, here we define it explicitly.

Here we store the nodes in a tuple to avoid accidental modification of the nodes.

There are two types of node groups. One with extended grid that is
used for calculate the cantilever motion and one without.

The nodes can be overridden by appending with a Node of the same name.
This behavior is allowed in the individual w
